Let's break down the code you've provided with a hypothetical example to clarify how the onlineUsers map and the getKey utility function work together in a chat application context.

Global Variable: onlineUsers

global.onlineUsers = new Map();
Purpose: This line creates a new Map called onlineUsers that will be used to store user IDs and their corresponding socket IDs. The Map allows for efficient lookups, additions, and deletions of entries.

Example Scenario
Imagine a chat application where users can log in and start chatting with each other. Each user is identified by a unique user ID.

User Connections:

When a user connects to the chat application, they are assigned a socket ID by the server. Let's say we have three users:
user1 connects and gets a socket ID of socket_abc123.
user2 connects and gets a socket ID of socket_def456.
user3 connects and gets a socket ID of socket_xyz789.
Adding Users to the Map:

When each user connects, their user ID and socket ID are added to the onlineUsers map:

onlineUsers.set("user1", "socket_abc123");
onlineUsers.set("user2", "socket_def456");
onlineUsers.set("user3", "socket_xyz789");
After these operations, the onlineUsers map would look like this:

makefile

onlineUsers = {
  "user1" => "socket_abc123",
  "user2" => "socket_def456",
  "user3" => "socket_xyz789"
}
Utility Function: getKey

const getKey = (map, val) => {
  for (let [key, value] of map.entries()) {
    if (value === val) return key;
  }
};
Purpose: This function takes a Map and a value (in this case, a socket ID) as parameters. It iterates through the entries of the map and returns the key (user ID) that corresponds to the provided value (socket ID).

Example Scenario with getKey
Suppose user1 disconnects from the chat application, and you want to remove them from the onlineUsers map. You only have the socket ID (socket_abc123), and you need to find the corresponding user ID to remove.

Finding the User ID:

You call the getKey function:

const userIdToRemove = getKey(onlineUsers, "socket_abc123");
The function iterates through the onlineUsers map:
It checks the first entry: key = "user1", value = "socket_abc123"; since they match, it returns user1.
The iteration stops here since it found the match.
Removing the User:

Now that you have the user ID (user1), you can remove them from the onlineUsers map:

onlineUsers.delete(userIdToRemove); // This removes "user1" from the map

User Connection
Adding a User:


socket.on("addUser", (userId) => {
  onlineUsers.set(userId, socket.id);
  socket.emit("getUsers", Array.from(onlineUsers));
});
Example: When a user with ID user123 connects to the chat, they emit an event called addUser with their user ID:


socket.emit("addUser", "user123");
The server receives this event and maps user123 to the socket ID of the connecting socket. For instance:
bash

onlineUsers.set("user123", "socketID_abc123");
The server then emits the updated list of online users back to the connected user.
Sending Messages
Sending a Message:


socket.on("sendMessage", ({ senderId, receiverId, message }) => {
  const sendUserSocket = onlineUsers.get(receiverId);
  if (sendUserSocket) {
    socket.to(sendUserSocket).emit("getMessage", {
      senderId,
      message,
    });
  }
});
Example: Suppose user123 wants to send a message to user456. The client emits the sendMessage event:


socket.emit("sendMessage", {
  senderId: "user123",
  receiverId: "user456",
  message: "Hello, how are you?",
});
The server checks if user456 is online by looking up their socket ID in the onlineUsers map. If user456 is online:
csharp

sendUserSocket = onlineUsers.get("user456"); // e.g., "socketID_def456"
The server then emits the message to user456's socket:


socket.to("socketID_def456").emit("getMessage", {
  senderId: "user123",
  message: "Hello, how are you?",
});
User Disconnection
Handling User Disconnection:


socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  onlineUsers.delete(getKey(onlineUsers, socket.id));
  socket.emit("getUsers", Array.from(onlineUsers));
});
Example: If user123 disconnects from the chat (e.g., closes the browser), the server handles the disconnect event:


socket.on("disconnect", () => { ... });
The server calls getKey(onlineUsers, socket.id) to find the user ID associated with the disconnected socket. If socket.id matches socketID_abc123, it retrieves user123 and removes them from the onlineUsers map:
go

onlineUsers.delete("user123");
Finally, the server emits the updated list of online users, excluding the disconnected user.
